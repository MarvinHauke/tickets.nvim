# Roadmap

Here are the planned features and improvements for Tickets.nvim:

## High Priority
- [ ] **Configurable Repository**: Allow users to define which GitHub repo to fetch issues from (currently hardcoded).
- [ ] **Issue UI**: Display fetched issues in a selectable list (floating window) instead of print messages.
- [ ] **Issue Details**: Pressing `Enter` on an issue in the list should show the full description.

## Medium Priority
- [ ] **Browser Open**: Add a keybinding to open the issue in the browser.
- [ ] **Filtering**: Filter issues by labels or assignee.
- [ ] **Creating Issues**: Command to draft and submit a new issue from Neovim.

## Low Priority
- [ ] **GitLab Support**: Extend support to GitLab APIs.
- [ ] **Comments**: View and add comments to issues.
