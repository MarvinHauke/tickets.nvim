# Browser Integration

*Currently, Tickets.nvim focuses on in-editor management.*

## Future Capabilities

We plan to add features that allow you to:
1.  Open the currently selected issue in your default web browser.
2.  Create new issues from within Neovim that sync to GitHub.

*Check the [Roadmap](../roadmap.md) for updates.*
